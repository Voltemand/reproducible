#' The \code{reproducible} package
#'
#' Built on top of \code{git2r} and \code{archivist}, this package aims at making
#' high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making deeply
#' reproducible and reusable content in R. This extends beyond the package
#' management utilities of \code{packrat} and \code{checkpoint} by including
#' tools for caching, and accessing GitHub repositories.
