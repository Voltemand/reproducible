\title{The \code{reproducible} package}
\description{
Built on top of \code{git2r} and \code{archivist}, this package aims at making
high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making deeply
reproducible and reusable content in R. This extends beyond the package
management utilities of \code{packrat} and \code{checkpoint} by including
tools for caching, and accessing GitHub repositories.
